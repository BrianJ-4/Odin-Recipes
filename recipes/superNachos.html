        <p>Cook and stir ground beef in a skillet over medium heat until meat is crumbly and no longer pink, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain excess grease. Stir in water and taco seasoning mix; simmer until beef mixture has thickened, 8 to 10 minutes.</p>

        <p>Broil in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, 3 to 5 minutes. Top nachos with olives, salsa, sour cream, green onions, and jalape単o peppers.</p>
